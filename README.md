## local testing
for local testing, you can simply use python: <br>
`python3 -m http.server` <br>
then connect to localhost:8000
<br> do NOT use python3 to host this website publicly, as python3 hosts websites in http and not https making the website unsecure and break for privacy minded folks with https only mode turned on in their browser. reccomended you also host using something like [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
