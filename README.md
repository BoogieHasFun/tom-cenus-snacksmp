tom cenus website for the 1.20.1 minecraft server, snacksmp

## local testing
for local testing, you can simply use python: <br>
`python3 -m http.server` <br>
then connect to localhost:8000
 
do NOT use python3 to host this website publicly, as python3 hosts websites in http and not https making the website unsecure. for self-hosting do your research, do not ask me.
