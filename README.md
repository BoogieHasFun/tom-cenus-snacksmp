tom cenus website for the 1.20.1 minecraft server, snacksmp

## local testing
for local testing, you can simply use python: <br>
`python3 -m http.server` <br>
then connect to localhost:8000
 
do NOT use python3 to host this website publicly, as python3 hosts websites in http and not https making the website unsecure and break for privacy minded folks with https only mode turned on in their browser. reccomended you also host using something like [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/). i am not a website hoster myself, though, so take what i said with a grain of salt and if you are going to self-host learn how to by someone else.
